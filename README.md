# EmptySource
A Tutorial for making Rendering C++ Applications using OpenGL 4.6

## Objectives
- [ ] Make a base for the framework
- [ ] Loading of complex models using Wavefront and COLLADA
- [ ] Build a complex space in the framework
- [ ] Voxeling
- [ ] Reflections
- [ ] Global Illumination
- [ ] Ambient Occlusion

## Frame Analysis

The main reason for this study is to create a rendering pipeline specialized in techniques using voxeling for calculating realistic rendering implementing features such as reflections, ambient occlusion and global illumination. As a goal, this work __will be__ extensively documented as well completely provided with easily interpretable code to make it easy and accessible as a learning material for share with game developers interested in this topics.

Topics to investigate: Voxeling, Rendering Pipelines using voxeling, OpenGL 4.6

### Geometry to Voxel space

The name voxel refers to the volume element which is in a discrete array that represent subdivisions in a three-dimensional space, this concept will be the primary concept in this thesis, this arrive as a solution because the common way the models in video-games are made of triangles or quads, in this form the calculus of raycasting will be expensive for a real time application, to solve this work will require the conversion of the volume of the triangles to a representation in a voxel space, this way the computational power using raycasting will be reduced in comparison of the triangles directly.
