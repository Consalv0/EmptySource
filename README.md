# EmptySource
A Tutorial for making Rendering C++ Applications using OpenGL 4.6

## Objectives
- [ ] Make a base for the framework
- [ ] Loading of complex models using Wavefront and COLLADA
- [ ] Build a complex space in the framework
- [ ] Voxeling
- [ ] Reflections
- [ ] Global Illumination
- [ ] Ambient Occlusion

## Frame Analysis

The main reason for this work is to create a rendering pipeline specialized in techniques using voxeling for calculating realistic rendering with reflections, ambient occlusion and global illumination. This document __will be__ extensively documented to share with the community interested in this topics.

Topics to investigate: Voxeling, Rendering Pipelines using voxeling, OpenGL 4.6
